#### A funny story

When I was very young and inexperienced, I tried to start a gas boiler. The gas is very dangerous, do not let children play with it! There was a button to start the flame. After a lot of attempts, I approached my face (to see better???) and that's when the flame was start. I had burned my eyebrows but luckily nothing more.
